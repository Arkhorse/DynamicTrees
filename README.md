# Dynamic Trees

Dynamic Trees is a visual and graphical mod for The Long Dark. 

It aims to add a bit more realism and immersion to the game by making the textures of the trees more dynamic, changing from bare green to partially covered to fully white as snow accumulates.

* Default texture of pine & cedar trees changed to coniferous green.
* Dynamic snow accumulation calculations depending on current weather & wind.
* Light and heavy snowfall, including blizzards, accumulates snow. Modified by wind.
* Clear & non-snowfall weather will decrease snow accumulation provided it's windy enough.

The textures on the trees will update in real-time as you hit a certain threshold. Each texture has been designed to gradually increase/decrease in coverage.
